Cascading Style Sheets
 <li style="color:purple> we can use like this also as an attribute but it is not a good way as at a time multiple styles cant be done.
We write css separately for html file we can put the css code in header part with style tag
syntax: <style type="text.css">
          selector { property: values;}
With link tag we can link css and html files link is put in html header
 color attribute can have 2 ways
color:#hexadecimal
color:rgb(0,255,0)
rgba works as rgb last channel is alpha for transperency having range 0-1 rgba(255,255,255,1)
 
///Background and border
background in body tag changes whole background
also we can have it for specifed header or para etc.
background:url() for image.
border has 3 parts width style and color.
border-color:width color style;

Css selectors element(li) id(#) and class(.)
If we want to style any one li then we should provide a id as attribute.
id cannot be duplicated.
if we want to change half of something then we should use class.
class is added as attribute in li
text decoration:line through to cut out something
.class should be used in css and #id.

///If we want to find something about page then select-rightclick -inspect

More selectors 
* - selects every thing on page
descendants tag if we want to select something inside li
eg. li a{ }
adjacent selector selects at same level we have to use +
attribute selector based on attribute
eg. a[href="url"] for input also input[type="text"]
nth-of-type() it is used to select every nth line

Inheritance and specificity
inheritance is what we apply to parent is by default applied to child
specificity is we can apply multiple styles to one element.the more relevant is applied for specificity

Lorem ipsum generator - used to generate random text.

font-family:"Arial"; for font check css font stack.
font-size: units px, 1em=16px
font-weight: bold for style also 100-800 is used.
line-height: 2; controls space between lines 2 is multiplied by current space.
text-align: right,centre,left.. to align para headers etc.
text decoration: underline; it is used to give underline or line effect.

Google fonts
We have to copy link and paste it in html header.

Box model
Each element have a box around it on webpage we can work on them.
p
{
	/*//Content -width and height*/
	width: 200px;
	height: 10%;
	/*padding*/
	padding: 10px;
	border: 2px solid blue;
	/*margin*/
	margin: 25px;
margin:top right bottom left;

}

float attribute is used to put things on same line and it removes little quirky space.



letter-spacing: 10rem rem is similar to em but rem refers to root element.
<hr> tags for horizontal rows.
