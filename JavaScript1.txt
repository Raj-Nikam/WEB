In Javascript "var" is a datatype for int and string.
Here we can change from one datatype to another without problem.
Variables should be camel case eg.camelCase
snake case=snake_case and dash case=dash-case are not allowed.
 
///Useful methods
..alert(--)..pop up on screen 
..prompt(--)..It takes input value in popup from user
..console.log()...It is like printf
..clear() 

We have to connect script and html file to work

JS have same operators as java and c
imp one is === and !==
JS does not care about type
== do not provide type coercion while triple does
string 1 and num 1 will be true using == but false using ===

JS Conditionals
Else,Else If,If

Number() is type conversion from int to string
typeof -- tells type of.

JS while
while(condition)
Avoid Infinite loops

//inde-of() method to get ind.

JS for
for(init;condition;step)

Functions
They are reusable bits of code
function name(){}----synta..

Higher order function takes func as an argument
setInterval(func,interval)--here it calls the func after every specified interval time
setInterval gives us a number in return
we have to use that number in clearInterval(num) to stop the func from further processing.

JS Arrays
 In Js array can have multiple elements with different datatypes
 var friends=[]
 var friends=new Array()  ////methods to create array
Methods
 arr.push(); to put something in array at very end. It also returns length of array after push
 arr.pop(); It removes the last item of array
unshift() it is same as push but it adds at start
shift() it removes first element
inde_Of() it returns inde_ of element if not present returns -1;
.slice() without argument copies entire array otherwise begin and end args are passed
.splice(inde,1) deletes 1 element of ind if 10 then delete 10

Iteration through array
using normal for loop and
arr.forEach(func(variable))
using while loop incrementing inside loop

Objects
Objects are in curly braces they are in key value pair
We can also create object in objects
Arrays have inde ,objects do not
We can also create methods inside object.
