Git

Using git we can move to older versions of our file.
We use command line to create git
First we have to initialise it using (git init)
Then check status using(git status) if file is in staging area.
If not then add using (git add filename) for multiple use(git .)
After that we have to commit our added files using (git commit -m "Savepoint name")
Use (git log) to get details.
(git diff filename) to get difference and (git checkout filename) to rollback
(git rm --cached -r) to remove files from staging area

Git for remote repository

Here we put files from local repos to remote repos
using (.gitignore) we stop pushing certain files
(git branch name) to create branch
(git merge branch name) to merge branchs
