Jquery makes our life easier by simplifying javascript.
why?--to use dom api simply makes code clearer shorter
using $ sign we can select what we want instead of using query selector
selecting with jquery
$(class or id).css(object or designing)
the looping for each element will be done automatically here.
Methods
text()- It gives us the all the text content in class or id we can also change text.
html()-It gives us inner html also we can update.
attr()-known as attribute it retrieves or set and attribute mostly the first of list.
last()-to get last element
val()-it gets us the value of selected instance and can also update.
addClass() and removeClass()- as the name suggests.
toggleClass()- will add if not present and vice versa.


Advanced JQuery

Jquery comes with tons of methods for events.
mostly used are click and keypress and on().
$(this) is this version of jquery
.click() method is like addeventlistener we can pass anonymous function inside it.
.keypress() method tells us about which key is pressed
  we only listen to keys but do something only when enter is clicked
  every key have unique keycode and charcode passing event in function we can see it
  e.which used to capture mouse as well as keyboard clicks it returns us keycode.
.on() it is similar to addeventlistener here we give name of event we want to look for
  .on('dblclick',func()..) etc; on takes methods like keypress,mouseleave etc.

Effects Jquery
 .fadeOut(time,func), .fadeIn, .fadeToggle etc.
 sliding effects slideup,slidedown,slidetoggle similar to upper methods.
