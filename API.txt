APIS'S
API are interfaces for code/computers to talk to one another
Using api we make our apps more attractive and useful.
In JSON and Ã—ml we get responses from servers
JS object notation is JSON.
Using curl from command line we can request api
//request library in node used to request
404 error means not found 404 is statusCode.
200 statusCode means OK.

We get API responses in String Format so we have to parse it using JSON.
eg. JSON.parse(body);

//Movie API 
omdb api
